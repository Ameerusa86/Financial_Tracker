here is the plan, we will create a github branch for every feature we will implement and then PR after testing.

what I'm currently doing

1. get paid every 2 weeks
2. open up all my Credit cards, loans websites and check my balances and then start paying
3. choose the amount of payments per how much is my balance
4. need to keep tracking on everything, income, expenses, payments due dates etc

1) my Checking accounts is my Salary/Income
2) I use my income to pay for the Credit Cards and loans
3) I used Credit cards for my daily expenses
4) I need to be able to track all the above
